GopherCon 2017 day 1 has concluded. From my perspective, it was a good day. The
talks were good. The hallway track was, as always, great. The food, fantastic.
The crowds, overwhelming.

The day started off with the keynote by [Tammy Butow](https://twitter.com/tammybutow).
From there, [Russ Cox](https://twitter.com/_rsc) provided a look at the future of
the Go language. After the break for coffee the day resumed with an attempt to
see [Liz Rice's](https://twitter.com/lizrice) talk on Syscalls. I say an atempt
was made because the crowds at GopherCon this year were unexpected both by me
and the GopherCon team. Popular track rooms quickly filled and many people were
unable to attend. This trend continued throughout the day. Thankfully, with better
planning, the afternoon tracks went better.

At 2PM [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower) spoke about the
possibilities of self deploying Go applications on Kubernetes. This talk was
informative and, as alwys, entertaining. I question the practicality of his
proposals in production but the idea of an application being able to self
deploy to a Kubernetes cluster is definitely worth further exploration.

That concluded the talks I attended for the day. There was another failed attempt
in the afternoon to attend the talk on Go Anti-Patterns, again due to over crowding.

I look forward to the rest of the week.
