I landed in Denver, CO yesterday for [GopherCon 2017](https://www.gophercon.com/).
I've never been to Denver before. I didn't know what to expect upon landing. I
had heard things, of course. Mostly through what I hear in the media. So, naturally,
the only thing I knew was that Marjuana was legal and widely available through
shops all over the state. What I wasn't expecting, however, was what I saw upon
approach to land at the airport. Miles and miles of flat farm land with a beautiful
backdrop of snow capped mountains. The second thing that struck me was how laid
back the airport atmosphere was. It's quite possibly the least busy airport I've
been to in recent memory. The final thing that struck me which I'll mention here
is the city. Denver is one of the most beautiful cities in the I've yet visited
in the United States. I was fortunate to have time after dinner to go for a walk
and look around. The city is clean. The people are friendly and the architecture
of the buildings around the capital is gorgeous, rivaled only by those I've seen
in Washington, DC.

If the first night in town is any indication of what's to come, I look forward to
the rest of my stay with great excitement.
